# Supporting Several Features and Final Fixes

Hi all, this was the final week of `GSoC`.
It was full of fun and learning.Â 
In this week, I worked on several features, which range from
automating the upload of wasm builds at `CI`
to implementing support for the `runtime` library.

We added the following features to the `wasm` backend during this week:
- Support for `runtime` library at [https://dev.lfortran.org/](https://dev.lfortran.org/)
- Support for defining functions in any order
- Support for basic string variables
- Support for importing functions from `JS` using `bind(C)` and interface approach
- Uploading the built `lfortran.js`, `lfortran.wasm` and `lfortran.data` to [https://github.com/lfortran/wasm_builds](https://github.com/lfortran/wasm_builds)
- Several minor (yet important) features/fixes

This phase was mostly/approximately from `13-08-2022` to `23-08-2022`.

The MRs during this phase are as follows:
