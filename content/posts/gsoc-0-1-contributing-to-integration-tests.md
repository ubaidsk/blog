# Contributing to Integration Tests

Initially, as a new-comer to the `LFortran` Project, I focused on adding and improving integration tests.
I also worked towards [#665](https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/issues/665)
and submitted an MR [!1677](https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/1677) to accomplish its first task.

This phase was mostly/approximately from `13-03-2022` to `20-04-2022`.

The MRs made during this phase are as follows:
- [!1674](https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/1674)
- [!1677](https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/1677)
- [!1680](https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/1680)
- [!1683](https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/1683)
- [!1685](https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/1685)
- [!1695](https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/1695)
- [!1707](https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests/1707)
